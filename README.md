# Data Project Assignment 3

The aim of this project was to analyze how the number of petitions is changing and what people are caring about. 

My personal goal was to improve my scraping skills and working with D3. 

## Data Collection

This is the source for my data:
- <a href"https://www.change.org/de">Change.org</a>

## Data Analysis

The data was analyzed using pandas. After focusing too much on analyzing the data in my first two projects and not enough on the process of data collection or visualization, I only performed a simple analysis this time.


## Key Findings
The analysis showed that the number of petitions on change.org is rising, but the number of petitions with over 30.000 supporters is constant. 
Also I found that many petitions want to stop something. However, people are more likely to sign petitions that seek to preserve something.

## Skills Learned and Used
This project allowed me to develop and refine several technical skills:

- Playwright: Automated scraping 
- Pandas: Cleaning and analyzing the data
- CSS and HTML: Focused more on creating my own CSS + HTML instead of using the template
- D3: Creating two charts with D3

This was my first time working with Playwright and D3. 

## Challenges and Things I Would've Liked to Do
While the analysis was insightful, there were areas left unexplored:

- AI classification of the titles, but I had no link to the single petitions. Also, I tried other methods, but it didn't work out, so it wasn't possible to say what people are caring about and why they are starting a petition. 
- Semantic Analysis with meaningfully but it did not work on my mac.
